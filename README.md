This is my portfolio page made with [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/prologue), now available as a blog to post the designs i did. It features a clean, minimalistic design and a sticky sidebar with navigation-linked scrolling.

* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Build your homepage with **custom scrolly sections** in the _sections folder
 * Set a **cover photo** for any section (not just the first), with alt text for screen readers and SEO
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`.
* Automatic search engine optimization (SEO) **meta tags** based on info you provide in `_config.yml` and frontmatter
* **Google Analytics** built-in; just put your [Tracking ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) in `_config.yml` as `google_analytics`
* Custom **404 page** (called 404.html; to activate, move it to your project directory).
